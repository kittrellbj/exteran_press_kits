## ðŸŽ¶ About *This Long Broken Road*
*This Long Broken Road* is the groundbreaking dual-album release from **Exteran Studios**. Written by songwriter and computer scientist **Brian Kittrell**, the project explores themes of **loss, resilience, redemption, and hope** through two AI-driven voice personas:

- **Dawson McCoy** â€“ raw grit, weight, and endurance.
- **Sadie McCoy** â€“ warmth, tenderness, and strength.

Every song was written and composed by Brian, drawn from decades of lived experience. The **AI personas** are not random generators, but carefully directed instruments that interpret his blueprint performances. The result: one story told in **parallel male and female voices**, giving listeners a choice in how they experience the journey.
